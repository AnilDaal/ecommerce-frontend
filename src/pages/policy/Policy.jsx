        Returns is a scheme provided by respective sellers directly under this
        policy in terms of which the option of exchange, replacement and/ or
        refund is offered by the respective sellers to you. All products listed
        under a particular category may not have the same returns policy. For
        all products, the returns/replacement policy provided on the product
        page shall prevail over the general returns policy. Do refer the
        respective item's applicable return/replacement policy on the product
        page for any exceptions to this returns policy and the table below
      </p>

      <p>
        The return policy is divided into three parts; Do read all sections
        carefully to understand the conditions and cases under which returns
        will be accepted.

      <p>Part 1 &ndash; Category, Return Window and Actions possible</p>

      <p>
        Part 2 - Returns Pick-Up and Processing In case of returns where you
        would like item(s) to be picked up from a different address, the address
        can only be changed if pick-up service is available at the new address
        During pick-up, your product will be checked for the following
        conditions:
      </p>

      <p>
        The field executive will refuse to accept the return if any of the above
        conditions are not met.
      </p>

      <p>
        For any products for which a refund is to be given, the refund will be
        processed once the returned product has been received by the seller.
      </p>

      <p>Part 3 - General Rules for a successful Return</p>

      <p>
        In certain cases where the seller is unable to process a replacement for
        any reason whatsoever, a refund will be given. In cases where a product
        accessory is found missing/damaged/defective, the seller may either
        process a replacement of the particular accessory or issue an eGV for an
        amount equivalent to the price of the accessory, at the seller&rsquo;s
        discretion. During open box deliveries, while accepting your order, if
        you received a different or a damaged product, you will be given a
        refund (on the spot refunds for cash-on-delivery orders). Once you have
        accepted an open box delivery, no return request will be processed,
        except for manufacturing defects. In such cases, these category-specific
        replacement/return general conditions will be applicable. Click here to
        know more about Open Box Delivery For products where installation is
        provided by Furniturelelo's service partners, do not open the product
        packaging by yourself. Furniturelelo authorised personnel shall help in
        unboxing and installation of the product. For Furniture, any
        product-related issues will be checked by authorised service personnel
        (free of cost) and attempted to be resolved by replacing the faulty/
        defective part of the product. Full replacement will be provided only in
        cases where the service personnel opines that replacing the
        faulty/defective part will not resolve the issue.'
